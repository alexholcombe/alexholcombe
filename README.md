### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher and educator in the School of Psychology at the University of Sydney (Australia).

I am trying to:

* Improve science
  * Helping researchers and publishers move beyond outdated authorship practices, toward [contributorship](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/).
  * Understanding and addressing problems like the peer review crisis (e.g., [1](https://researchintegrityjournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s41073-021-00118-2))
* Understand human attention, and discover new things about it by doing experiments.
