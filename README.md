### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a researcher and educator in the School of Psychology at the University of Sydney (Australia).

My interests include 

* Improving science, e.g. through moving beyond authorship, to [contributorship](https://contributorshipcollaboration.github.io/)
* Understanding human attention, and discovering new things about it by doing experiments.
